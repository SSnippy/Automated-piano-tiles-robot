1) On the base make a place for the phone to steadily be in place and using measurement of the game screen make places for the servos to sit relatively higher compared to the phones base.
2) Make servo arms long enough to reach from servos to phone, these will replicate the human finger for the touch
	2.1) At the point of contact between arm and phone, on the arm attach some conducting material which we will ground in arduino to induce capacitive touch on the screen.
3) Make a sort of holding board/place for the ldrs to hold them steadily above the phone, one ldr dedicated to each lane in the game.
4) Assemble everything in such a way that each lane in the game gets one ldr and its one corresponding servo.
5) Make the connections to the breadboard and the arduino and upload the code.
6) Check the base position and click position for each servo and delay with respect to each ldr and corresponding servo and update the code before uploading to arduino.
7) turn on the system and test.

Caution:
#do not use arudion as power supply for servo like the ldr as servos require 6V or current and will short the system.
#do not use glue to stick ldr or arduino as they have open connections on their board and it migh disrupt or permanently damage them. use double stick tape
#handle each component with care.
