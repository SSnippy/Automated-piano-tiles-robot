multiple jumper cables
1- sturdy base/board

Directory:
1) Circuitry folder has images of the project.
2) Code folder has the code writted using Arduino IDE software.
3) Circuit diagrams are present in the main folder.
4) Building instructions.

Thats it for this project, Thank you for taking time and looking throug!!
Hope to see you again!!! :D
